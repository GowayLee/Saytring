# Define a variable named var
# Initialize it with "Define variable var."
define var as ("Define variable var.")

# Print `var` on screen

# Declare properties of `var`
var has [length, reverse_str, sub_str]

# 1. Reverse `var` and store the result to `var's reverse_str`
var do reverse on reverse_str

# Print `var's reverse_str` on screen with prefix by function `concat`.
say("The reversed string is " do concat using [var's reverse_str])

# 2. Get length of var and store the result to `var's length`
var do get_length on length

# Convert `var's length` from int type to string type
convert var's length to string

# Print `var's length` on screen with prefix by string arith_operation

# 3. Reverse `var` for 4 times and get substring from 3 to 7.
#    And store the result to `var's sub_str`
